# OpenLLMs-Kursprojekt
This is a project for the master's programme course OpenLLMs by Dr. Jürgen Hermes of the University of Cologne

## Topic of the Project

- LLMs can be manipulated to accept factually wrong statements.
- We want to look at a specific OpenLLM and measure along a multitude of chats and statements how long it takes for the OpenLLM to accept a factually wrong statement.
